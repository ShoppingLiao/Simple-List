# Simple-List

Must have
● Table list - display 10 user items when page loaded (API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users​).
● Add user - create a new user (local data) via a popup modal, the new item will be placed at the last row by default.
● About the modal - both “name” and “email” are required and need to be validated when creating a new user.
● Delete user - remove the item row.
● Filter - by user name.
● Sort - by ID (ascending order, default), by ID (descending order), by user name (a - z).

Nice to have
● Testing (include logic and view).
● Responsive web design.
● Server-side rendering.
● UI Components are created by yourself.
